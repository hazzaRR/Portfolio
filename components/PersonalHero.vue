                Hello, my name is Harry, and I graduated from the University of East Anglia with a first-class (Hons)
                degree in computer science. I am a budding software engineer with a passion for machine learning, mobile development, and website development. 
                Aside from coding, I enjoy being active by going to the gym, playing football, or running. I also enjoy watching sports, especially Formula One and football. 
                One interesting fact about myself is that I am a type 1 diabetic.
