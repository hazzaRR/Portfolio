        "content": "This project evaluates the performance of various classification algorithms on a dataset of gym exercises recorded using time series data from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone device. The primary objective is to determine if you can accurately classify gym exercises based on the sensor data collected. The project compares a number of common machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbours with Euclidean Distance and Na√Øve Bayes, as well as some time series specific algorithms, including Rocket and Time Series Forest, on a range of different variations of the dataset. These variations include different attributes such as using univariate data from a single axis or using multivariate data by combining data from multiple axes. Prior to analysis, the time series data is pre-processed to use same-length normalised time series data of 10 seconds. The results of this project show that when using multivariate time series data that uses both the accelerometer and gyroscope data, an accuracy of 99.2% can be achieved using the Rocket classifier.",

        "content": "I developed a robust appointment booking system tailored for local business owners. The backend, developed using Spring Boot, seamlessly integrates with a PostgreSQL database to allow owners to effortlessly create, update, delete, and manage appointments, services, and client details. The Vue 3 frontend enhances the user interface, ensuring a smooth experience for the owner and easy interaction with the REST API backend. One standout feature is the system's ability to generate summary reports of appointments within specified date ranges, simplifying administrative tasks for tax and business purposes. Additionally, the system offers a convenient PDF generation feature. To streamline communication, automated emails are sent to clients upon appointment creation, including comprehensive details and service information using Java Mail API. A unique touch is the integration of the Java Mail API, Spring Scheduler, and cron jobs, enabling the system to automatically send 24-hour reminders to clients before their scheduled appointments. Moreover, confirmation emails come with .ics files, allowing clients to effortlessly add appointments to their online calendars. This personal project showcases my proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue 3, and my ability to create a practical, user-friendly solution for business management. To demonstrate my cloud skills and allow for seamless accessibility I deployed the whole system to Azure. The Spring boot backend is hosted on Azure App Service, the Vue.js frontend on Azure Static web apps and finally, the Postgres database using Postgres flexible server.",

The blog app implemented full CRUD functionality, enabling users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations seamlessly through the REST API. Security was important and therefore I incorporated JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication with asymmetric keys using Spring Security to authenticate user interactions. I made use of Azure services for deployment in order to guarantee a dependable and seamless user experience. Azure Static Web Apps hosted the frontend, and Azure App Service was used to deliver the backend. I used GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that streamlined the deployment process. This guarantees that any updates or modifications made to the codebase are smoothly integrated into the live application in addition to facilitating an automated deployment process. Furthermore, I set up a PostgreSQL database using Azure PostgreSQL servers to store blog posts and user information. This was also integrated with Azure Blob Storage for media file storage.",
