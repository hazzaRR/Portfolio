        "content": "This project evaluates the performance of various classification algorithms on a dataset of gym exercises recorded using time series data from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone device. The primary objective is to determine if you can accurately classify gym exercises based on the sensor data collected. The project compares a number of common machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbours with Euclidean Distance and Na√Øve Bayes, as well as some time series specific algorithms, including Rocket and Time Series Forest, on a range of different variations of the dataset. These variations include different attributes such as using univariate data from a single axis or using multivariate data by combining data from multiple axes. Prior to analysis, the time series data is pre-processed to use same-length normalised time series data of 10 seconds. The results of this project show that when using multivariate time series data that uses both the accelerometer and gyroscope data, an accuracy of 99.2% can be achieved using the Rocket classifier.",

The blog app implemented full CRUD functionality, enabling users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations seamlessly through the REST API. Security was important and therefore I incorporated JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication with asymmetric keys using Spring Security to authenticate user interactions. I made use of Azure services for deployment in order to guarantee a dependable and seamless user experience. Azure Static Web Apps hosted the frontend, and Azure App Service was used to deliver the backend. I used GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that streamlined the deployment process. This guarantees that any updates or modifications made to the codebase are smoothly integrated into the live application in addition to facilitating an automated deployment process. Furthermore, I set up a PostgreSQL database using Azure PostgreSQL servers to store blog posts and user information. This was also integrated with Azure Blob Storage for media file storage.",

The app records accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in an Android smartphone at a frequency of 10 Hz and records 15 seconds of data. To create the app and access the phone's sensors, I utilised Android Studio Java. In addition, I set up a Python Flask server that ran my trained machine learning model, allowing for real-time predictions within the app by sending API calls to the Flask server.",
