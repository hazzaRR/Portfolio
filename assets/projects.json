The app utilises the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors present in an Android smartphone. I used Android Studio Java to build the app and access the phoneâ€™s sensors. Additionally, I deployed a Python Flask server that ran my trained machine learning model, allowing real-time predictions within the app."
